# Stack

Stack is a `layout` component that can be used to lay other components out.

<Preview>
  <Story id="stack--simple" />
</Preview>

This is essentially a glorified wrapper around flexbox with 1 additional feature.

<Props of={Stack} />

<Preview withSource="open">
  <Story id="stack--flex" />
</Preview>

You can add margin between consecutive elements using the `gap` prop without setting width on the container.

<Preview withSource="open">
  <Story id="stack--gap" />
</Preview>
